# Inception

Inception is a utility to group files in a directory based on some rules. The rules are stored in a configuration file which can be edited by the user. Two variants of the utility is planned. One is a command line tool and other is a GUI based tool.

## Motivation

Cluttered directories in most of the computers we have worked on. Some might be organised but will collect a bunch of files over time and need to spend some time to classify the files and move it to corresponding folders. When the number of files grows again it will be difficult to go to each directory and do the same boring task again and again. So we are trying to build a tool to do that boring task.
